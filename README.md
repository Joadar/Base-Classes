# Base-Classes
A simple Android library to help with basics *generics classes* I mostly used in my projects.

## Implementation

Current version: `0.1.3`

Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:

```
allprojects {
  repositories {
    ...
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
  }
}
```

Add the dependency
```
compile 'com.github.joadar:base-classes:{VERSION}'
```
